# Guest Image Viewer

## Overview

Guest Image Viewer is a simple Flutter application designed to securely display specific images shared with it, without granting access to the device's entire photo gallery.

This app was initially created at the request of a friend who needed this specific functionality.

## Features

* **PIN Protection:** Requires setting a 4-8 digit PIN on the first launch.
* **Secure Storage:** The PIN is stored securely on the device.
* **Share Target:** Accepts images shared from other applications (e.g., Gallery, Files).
* **Isolated Viewing:** Only displays the images explicitly shared *to* this app during the current session.
* **Image Swiping:** Allows swiping left and right between the shared images.
* **Secure Exit:** Requires the PIN to be entered correctly before allowing the user to navigate back or exit the image viewer screen.

## How to Use

1.  **First Launch:** Set your secure PIN when prompted.
2.  **Share Images:** Go to your device's Gallery or another app, select one or more images, and use the standard "Share" function. Choose "Guest Image Viewer" from the list of apps.
3.  **View Images:** The app will open (or come to the foreground) and display the shared images. Swipe left or right to navigate.
4.  **Exit:** Press the back button (either the system back button or the one in the AppBar). You will be prompted to enter your PIN to exit the viewer and clear the current images.

## Setup (for Developers)

If building from source, ensure you configure the necessary platform specifics:

* **Android:** Update `AndroidManifest.xml` to include the `<intent-filter>` tags for `ACTION_SEND` and `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE` with `mimeType="image/*"`. Ensure the main `<activity>` has `android:launchMode="singleTask"` or `singleTop`.
* **iOS:** Update `Info.plist` with appropriate keys like `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` and potentially `CFBundleDocumentTypes` for `public.image`. Refer to the `receive_sharing_intent` package documentation for detailed iOS setup.

## Dependencies

This app utilizes several key packages:

* `flutter_secure_storage`: For saving the PIN securely.
* `receive_sharing_intent`: To handle images shared from other apps.
* `provider`: For basic state management of shared images.
* `path_provider`: For handling file paths.
* `permission_handler`: To request necessary permissions.
